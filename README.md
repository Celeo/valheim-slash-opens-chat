# valheim-slash-opens-chat

A plugin for [Valheim](https://www.valheimgame.com/) that allows faster command execution by allowing you to open the chat window with the slash key `/` in addition to the default enter key. Doing so puts that slash key in your input as well.

Basically, it saves you a single key, but it's more for the muscle memory I have for using the slash key to open chat windows in MMOs.

## Building

You'll need Visual Studio.

1. Clone repo
1. Create a Libs\\ directory in the project root
1. Download BepInEx to your machine
1. Copy in the following files to the Libs\\ directory from the game or from BepInEx:
	- 0Harmony.dll
	- assembly_valheim.dll
	- BepInEx.dll
	- UnityEngine.CoreModule.dll
	- UnityEngine.dll
	- UnityEngine.UI.dll
	- UnityEngine.InputLegacyModule.dll
